## Objective
I recreated this simple credit card UI. All of the images and original design was from the CodingLab Youtube Channel. All other code and styling was made by me

## Reflection
I did not have any challenges at all! I was able to successsfully recreare the credit card UI in under an hour, which is a personal milestone. I want to be able to tackle more projects like this with better timing, ideally under 30 minutes.
